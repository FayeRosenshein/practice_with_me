# About Me
Hi all. I’m Leon Rosenshein. If you see me I’ll probably be in a Hawaiian shirt, Fedora, and shorts.

I’m a Mechanical and Aerospace Engineer by training and sort of drifted into computers and infrastructure. I started my career doing flight simulation for the US Air Force and games (Falcon 4, Flight Simulator, Combat Flight Simulator, Train Simulator). Prior to joining Amazon and the Just Walk Out team, I worked at Aurora and Uber/ATG on infrastructure for developing and testing autonomous vehicles. Between simulation and robot vehicles I worked on all aspects of online mapping, from data collection and processing to 3D modeling and rendering at Microsoft.

I’m currently working on Amazon’s Just Walk Out technology. My focus is the ML training/evaluation backend, helping the team scale out and launch more stores. Everything from data set generation and management to model training and ongoing evaluation. It’s still early days at Amazon for me, but I’m having fun and learning a lot.

I’ve been in Louisville, CO for since 2007. You can often see me walking to the office, regardless of the weather. When not at my day job or working on this blog I spend a lot of time reading and building LEGO models. I’m currently working on the Space Shuttle/Hubble, Hogwarts Castle, and the Boutique Hotel.
